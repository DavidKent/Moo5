PROGRESS - 
    Finished authentication, using my ironhide plugin. Users may now log in if their database is set up, pages must be restricted using
    ironhide's handle function as of now. Pretty messy right now, need to finish inbox messaging and then I will move on to other things
    such as user accounts and all that fun stuff.
